# Have Healthy Body With Rice

## About This Project

This is my first web project, where I'm learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this website is to promote healthy eating habits, focusing on rice. The project demonstrates the use of different elements like JavaScript interactivity, HTML metadata, and CSS styling.

You can visit the page to learn how to eat rice in a healthy way!

## Features
- **Dynamic List**: You can click anywhere on the page to add a new list item, and click any list item to change its text. This interaction is handled using JavaScript.
- **Multi-Language Content**: Includes content in English and Traditional Chinese, showcasing the multilingual capability.
- **Meta Information**: Implements Open Graph meta tags for better sharing on social media.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses proper meta tags to support different device screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the website.
- **CSS**: External stylesheet to handle visual styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the web page (dynamically adding and editing list items).

## How to Run

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthy-rice-website.git
